# PrideGame

TRIGGER WARNING: Mentions of queerphobia, News articles about queerphobic violence  

This is a game developed by me, celebrating Pride month and raising awareness for queer issues.

## The concept

I wanted to make a quick and simple game calling out queerphobic people by showing news articles about violence towards queer people.

## Have a look!
